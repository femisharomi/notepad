## Getting Started
[Explain how to get started with your project. This may include installation instructions, dependencies, and basic setup steps.]

## Prerequisites
[List any software, libraries, or tools that users need to have installed before they can use your project.]

## Installation
[Provide detailed steps on how to install your project. Include any configuration steps.]

## Pre-commit Hook
[Explain the purpose of the pre-commit hook and provide step-by-step instructions on how users can set it up.]
* Copy&paste the pre-commit file (it does not have a file ext) from templates/ to .git/hooks/ to ensure the correct file header is generated for each C/C++ file type committed back to the branch.
* A hardcoded copy of the header template is also in the templates/ dir for manual use. 

## Usage
[Provide examples or instructions on how to use your project. Include code snippets or screenshots if necessary.]

## Folder Structure
- **Zero (Top Level):**
  - **Projects:**
    - Each project resides in its own folder at the top level, encapsulating its unique application development focus.
  - **README and .gitignore:**
    - Essential documentation and version control settings at the repository level.
  - **Templates:**
    - Centralized storage for reusable templates and assets applicable across projects.

### Organization Inside Each Project Folder
- **`Project_Name`:**
  - Folder named after the project.
  - Contains all files necessary for building the project.
  - **`CMakeLists.txt`:**
    - CMake configuration file for project building and management.
    - Used to build the entire application, assuming all prerequisites are installed.
- **`build_Project_Name_Debug`:**
  - Folder with the syntax `build_Project_Name_Debug`.
    - Contains the project along with debug configurations.
    - Useful for quick testing, but developers are encouraged to create personalized configurations for release builds.

This structure facilitates efficient navigation, ensuring that developers can seamlessly explore various C++ application scenarios. The inclusion of project-specific details and configurations empowers users to delve into specific projects and tailor their learning experience. The centralized Templates folder further enhances reusability and consistency across the entire repository.
