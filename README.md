## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the "project name" folder to access the source code.
- The compiled executable (.exe/.app) can be found in the "build" folder.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the latest version of Qt installed for Win or Mac: [https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools).
- Current build folders contain the .app for MacOS.
  - If you're on Windows you will need to build and run the source code to create a Win build of the application.   

## Pre-commit Hook
* Copy & paste the pre-commit file (it does not have a file ext) from templates/ to .git/hooks/ to ensure the correct file header is generated for each C/C++ file type committed back to the branch.
* A hardcoded copy of the header template is also in the templates/ dir for manual use. 

## Folder Structure
- **`Project_Name`:**
  - Folder named after the project.
  - Contains all files necessary for building the project.
  - **`CMakeLists.txt`:**
    - CMake configuration file for project building and management.
    - Used to build the entire application, assuming all prerequisites are installed.
- **`.gitignore`:**
    - The `.gitignore` file is currently set up to block the debug folder from being tracked by Git. If removed then the following debug folder will be added to the branch:
    	- ***`build_Project_Name_Debug`:***
     		- Folder with the syntax `build_Project_Name_Debug`.
       		- Contains the project along with debug configurations.
         	- Useful for quick testing, but developers are encouraged to create personalized configurations for release builds.
